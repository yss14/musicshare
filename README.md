## Motivation
iTunes used to be a really great and simple yet powerful music library, but suffered user experience, platform support, and mobility during the recent years.

Streaming services became the way listening to music nowadays, but you are not the owner of the music.

MusicShare is there to combine both ideas - providing a simple yet powerful service to manage and share your own self-hosted music library.

## Current Development Status
We are working hard to release the first version of MusicShare. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/yss14/musicshare/wiki/Roadmap) and [project status](https://github.com/yss14/musicshare/projects).
