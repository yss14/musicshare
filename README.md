## Motivation
iTunes used to be a really great and simple yet powerful music library, but suffered user experience, platform support, and mobility during the recent years.

Streaming services became the way listening to music nowadays, but you are not the owner of the music.

MusicShare is there to combine both ideas - providing a simple yet powerful service to manage and share your own self-hosted music library.

## Current Development Status
We are working hard to release the first version of MusicShare. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/yss14/musicshare/wiki/Roadmap) and [project status](https://github.com/yss14/musicshare/projects).

## Local Setup

### Run The Project
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install and bootstrap dependencies
3. Create local configurations for `frontend` and `backend` by copying the sample `.env` files (`cp projects/backend/config/development_sample.env projects/backend/development.env && cp projects/frontend/config/sample.env projects/frontend/.env`)
4. Create and run `cassandra` database with docker (`docker-compose up`)
5. Run everything in `dev` mode by `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

If you want to run parts of the project seperatly, have a look at the provided scripts of the root [package.json](package.json).

### Testing
To execute the test cases, you need to create a separate `test.env`, for both the `backend` and `cassandra-schema-builder` 
project (`cp projects/backend/config/development_sample.env projects/backend/test.env && cp projects/backend/config/development_sample.env projects/cassandra-schema-builder/test.env`), 
and adjust the database connection variables accordingly.
