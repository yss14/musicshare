## Motivation

iTunes used to be a great and simple yet powerful music library, but suffered user experience, platform support, and mobility during the recent years.

Streaming services became the way listening to music nowadays with great multi platform support and modern user interfaces, but with the caveat of not being the owner of the music.

MusicShare is there to combine both ideas - providing a simple yet powerful service to manage and share your own self-hosted music library.
